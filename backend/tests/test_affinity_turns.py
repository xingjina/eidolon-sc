"""What the user says changes her affinity (GLOSSARY.md「好感度」), as the deployer's judge
model judges each turn before she replies: by a step for each of five levels, from hurting
her (−1.5) to making her very happy (+0.2), the likeliest level taken and two as likely as each
other changing nothing; by −10 for what is out of line, whatever the level; never up for
what tries to dictate it. Turns raise it by 0.6 a day at most, the day in Beijing wherever
the user is, the last of it as far as it goes; nothing limits how far they lower it. It falls no lower than
0, where a cooldown begins.

It changes as the turn is recorded, and the change is recorded with her reply: up or down,
to which tier, whether that is another, whether a cooldown began; nothing where nothing
changed. `done` tells it and where her affinity is left; reading the conversation's
messages tells it again. A turn not recorded changes nothing, nor one the judge model
cannot judge. Where retrieval is on its judge asks the questions in the same request;
otherwise they are asked apart. Off, the judge model is never asked them.

Driven through the backend's external API, the judge model faked turn by turn; what is
kept is read from the database for the exact steps."""
