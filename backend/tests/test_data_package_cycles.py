"""The periods the user wrote down in data packages (GLOSSARY.md「周期」「数据包」): a category
of its own, `cycles`, each record its character, first day and days, nothing else; imported,
they join those there, each checked as it is: one of a character not there, out of 1 to 10
days, after today where the producer is, or overlapping another of hers, those there first
or imported before it, is skipped, and said so. Exported and imported with cycles off too.
Driven through the API, records written down as `test_cycle_records.py` writes them."""
