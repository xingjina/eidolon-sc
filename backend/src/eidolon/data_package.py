"""Data packages (GLOSSARY.md「数据包」, ADR-0025): a user's own data as a zip they keep,
exported here and imported into this deployment or another, under this account or another.
The format is described for people in `docs/data-package-format.md`.

A package holds `manifest.json` first, stored uncompressed so that a browser can read it
from the start of the file alone; then the picture of each photo sent, a WebP of its own in
`photos/`; then `data.json`, indented, in English keys; and nothing else. The manifest
says which format the package is in (`FORMAT`), when it was exported, which categories it
holds and how many of each. A deployment imports packages of its own format and older ones,
and refuses newer ones (`TooNew`) rather than drop what it cannot read. Anything else wrong with a package refuses it as broken (`BrokenPackage`).

Importing unzips and checks a package first, off the database, then writes everything in
one write task (`data_access`), one transaction, so that a package fails as a whole and
leaves nothing behind, and holds up no one else's writes while it is unzipped. Neither
exporting nor importing is recorded: no activity record, nothing an admin sees."""
