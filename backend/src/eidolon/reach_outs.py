"""Reach-outs (GLOSSARY.md「搭话」): what she says first in her current conversation with the
user, the user not talking to her, once her time comes; whether or not the user is there to
see it.

Only where the deployer turns them on (`LiveConfig.reach_outs`). Every `TICK` the backend
runs, each user's current conversation with each character (GLOSSARY.md「当前对话」) is looked
at, if they were last in touch in it within `WINDOW`: when her last turn was recorded, or a
call that connected ended, whichever was later; gifts are not being in touch. Her time is
then the last contact and a time drawn from her tier's range (`INTERVALS`), at a place in it
drawn once for each contact (`PLACES`), drawn anew as the contact changes; trust's where
affinity is off. A conversation she is not to reach out in is passed over, its time left as
it is, to be looked at again at the next tick: one she has ended; one without a turn yet;
one she has reached out in since the last contact, so that she waits for the user to answer
first; one she is in a cooldown in, or cold or distant; one with a text turn under way or a
call; one of a user banned, or one an admin lets take no turns on the deployer's keys; one of
a user who has switched their own switch off (`switch`), on by default.

Her time goes by the producer's day, in the profile's time zone (or `Asia/Shanghai`): one
that falls in the `NIGHT`, or comes while it is night, is put off to the `MORNING` after,
at a place in it drawn once for each contact. One past `WINDOW` after the last contact is
given up till they are in touch again. Those whose time has come at a tick come in the order
of their times, each user reached out to at most as many times a day as the deployer sets;
one over it is put off to a time drawn in the next day's `MORNING`. One whose time came
before the backend started is not made up for, nor one that fails, the model failing or
saying nothing she could say: each is put off from now by a time drawn anew from her tier's
range.

She reaches out on the deployer's chat model as text turns use it, whoever's LLM the user
brings, held only while she does (`ConversationEngine.reach_out`): nothing counts towards the
user's limits. Each reach-out has an activity record of its own (`reach_out`), on the
deployer's keys, its service calls under it, so that the dashboard's usage and costs count
them; one that fails is recorded failed; one the user and she were in touch meanwhile,
looked at again as it is recorded (`Store.add_reach_out`), is not recorded, refused.
