"""Affinity (GLOSSARY.md「好感度」): each user's with each character, kept apart, across
all their conversations and calls with her.

Every number it goes by is here, and only here: neither `.env` nor the admin console
changes them. They hold each other in check, so changing one means checking the others.
Inside it is a number from 0 to 100, kept with its fractions, since it recovers as time
goes by; users see only its tier. Tiers, the cooldown's start and its end are all judged
on the number as it is, never rounded.

Nothing recovers it on a schedule: it is kept with the time it was as of, and whoever
reads it adds what it has recovered since. Below the normal value it recovers evenly, 10
a day, up to the normal value; above it, it never falls back. A cooldown begins as it
falls to 0 and ends as it recovers to the thaw line, so that when one ends is known, a
day at most after it began; it recovers while affinity is off all the same.

What the user says changes it, as the deployer's judge model judges each turn
(`affinity_judge`): by a step for each of five levels, from hurting her to making her very
happy; by more for what is out of line, whatever the level; never up for what tries to
dictate it. Turns raise it slowly, so much a day at most (`day_of`); nothing limits how far
they lower it. It changes as the turn is recorded, and only then: a turn
that fails, is rejected or is left changes nothing.

In her period and the days before it (GLOSSARY.md「周期」「体贴」), with cycles on, the judge
model is asked whether the user was considerate too (ADR-0030), and turns go by these days'
numbers (`HER_DAYS_LEVEL_STEPS` and those after it): what lowers it, by more; what is
considerate, by more again, so much a day at most, apart from the turns' own; and she warns,
hangs up or ends the conversation sooner. Out of line is as ever.

It shapes how she speaks to the producer, the same for every character, each in her own way
(`affinity_prompt`): colder below trust, warmer above it, as she is in trust otherwise; and as what
the user said is judged to hurt her or make her happy, she knows it as she replies to it.

In a call she hangs up after the turn that cools her into a cooldown, after the user has
been out of line in it too many times, or after the call's latest turns have hurt her too
much between them (`ends`), as weighed apart from what they take off her affinity (`hurt`);
halfway to that, she warns the user first (`warns`). A cooldown begun elsewhere has her hang
up the user's calls with her straight away, as whoever recorded the turn that began it tells
the calls once it is recorded (`Affinities.change` says it began). Nothing else has her hang
up. Outside calls the same has her end the conversation (GLOSSARY.md「已结束的对话」), by the same
numbers, counted over the conversation's latest typed turns rather than the call's.

Gifts (GLOSSARY.md「礼物」) raise it by their rarity and by more if she likes the one given, the
rarest she likes by more than a day's turns can, a warm one by more again in her days; in
a cooldown each by the same, enough that four end it; draws give them, a chance a day, and
now and then a reset card instead (GLOSSARY.md「抽奖」「重置卡」), which brings every character
below trust back to the normal value, out of any cooldown, none of them the wiser. How much and how likely are here with the rest.
A job of hers the producer scheduled (GLOSSARY.md「日程」) raises it once done, as a gift does
but by the same whatever the job and in a cooldown alike, told of to no one (`schedule`).
The day's first visit to the bar done (GLOSSARY.md「光顾」) raises it likewise, by how well her
drinks were served, as much as a job done at most and never down (`bar`).
What the system gives (draw chances, reset cards) never raises it: only what she feels does,
turns, gifts, jobs done and visits.

It is on only where the deployment has the judge model and the switch「好感度和礼物」is on
(`LiveConfig.affinity_on`); off, nothing of it is shown, but what is kept stays as it is.
Deleting the user deletes it (`database.USER_DATA`); deleting memories does not touch it.
